## How to Use
This app obtains/submits data through the [Quantified Self API] () ([repo](https://github.com/RajaaBoulassouak/Quantified_Self_BE)). Currently, this is a one page website, utilizing Javascript for all interactions to change displays and make HTTP GET/POST/DELETE requests from the API.
